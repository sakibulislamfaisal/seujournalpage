          Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) education has entered a
          transitional phase because the technology is changing every day. The
          diversity of EEE education is also increasing underscoring its
          multi-disciplinary nature. All the areas of the electrical and
          electronic engineering are growing rapidly and new fascinating
          disciplines of this subject are being created. Thus role of and
          Electrical and Electronic Engineer has changed significantly.
          Employers demand an Engineer with excellent communication skills along
          with skills of multi-disciplinary engineering. Keeping this in mind,
          the curriculum of the Department of Electrical and Electronic
          Engineering (EEE) of Southeast University has been designed. The main
          focus of the EEE Department curriculum is on four major areas- power
          and energy, electronics, communication and computer in the
          undergraduate curricula. A student is expected to specialize in one of
          these groups without compromising the fundamental knowledge in EEE.
          Our specifically targeted curriculum will prepare graduates to compete
          in the high-tech job market on a global scale. In addition to the
          foreign job opportunities, graduates can avail job opportunities at
          home, both in public and private sector in the diversified areas, such
          as, Electrical Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution,
          Sub-Station Design Firms, Telecommunication Industry, Wireless and
          Mobile Telecommunication Companies, Satellite Communication Systems,
          Integrated Circuit (IC) Design, Satellite Television Channels,
          Telecommunication Switching Systems, Wired and Wireless Networking,
          Consumer Electronics Appliance Manufacturer, Process Industries,
          Textile Industries, Computer Industry, Electrical and Electronic
          Design Firms, Microprocessor and Microcontroller Based Systems, Real
          Estate Sectors, etc. The EEE Department is committed to provide the
          students various modern laboratories equipped with the
          state-of-the-art equipment, training kits, test and measuring
          instrument, simulation software packages. The department is also
          committed to the study and analysis of fundamental as well as applied
          problems. Faculty Members and students of the EEE Department work in
          solving the complex engineering problems in the conventional and
          emerging fields. The EEE Department has recruited well-qualified
          faculty members graduated from BUET, DU, JU and other foreign
          universities. They are very much dedicated and committed to our
          students. They provide enough time and efforts to the students and
          engage them in teaching, learning and research. The research areas of
          the faculty members of EEE Department include electrical power,
          renewable and solar energy systems, electrical machines, semiconductor
          device modeling and simulation, digital signal processing, power
          electronics, biomedical electronics, control engineering, optical
          fiber communication, wireless and mobile communications, VLSI and
          ULSI, nano-technology, electrical and electronic engineering education
          etc. Faculty members of this department take part in active teaching,
          research activities, consultancy, collaborative research work,
          curricula and laboratory developments etc. The Department of
          Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Southeast University (SEU) is
          striving to realize its vision, mission and program educational
          objectives to place itself on the top position in the country. To
          promote research activities further, the Department of Electrical and
          Electronic Engineering has decided to publish a half-yearly based
          journal named ‘Southeast University Journal of Electrical and
          Electronic Engineering’ or ‘SEUJEEE’ in its abbreviated form. The
          SEUJEEE welcomes submissions of research articles from various
          diversified fields of electrical and electronic engineering from home
          and abroad. It is a peer-reviewed, international, and archival journal
          providing a publication medium for complete coverage addressing all
          topics of interest to academics, researchers, professionals,
          practitioners, educators, developers, managers, and executives in the
          fields mentioned in its scope section. Its goal is to foster the
          advancement of the state-of-the-art electrical and electronic
          engineering fields. The journal solicits original, high quality, and
          unpublished research papers, or extended versions of papers presented
          at conferences. The journal will have both print and electronic
          version with separate ISSN. Besides, the editorial board will try for
          indexing of this journal gradually.
